# Day 10

Learning Functions with outputs 
    - expanding from what we know from functions & functions with inputs
    - multiple return values (to check for corner cases, invalid inputs )
    - docstrings
    - how to put functions in dictionaries and to call them
    - recursively call the function

Exercises that made the newfound knowledge to practice
    - Days In month: helps with using the outputs from a function as boolean conditions
    - Calculator: putting the functions into dictionaries, having a recursively called function,
