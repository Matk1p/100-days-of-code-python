#Day 20

Today, essentially incorporating turtle graphics with the concepts we've learnt so far, like modules and classes.
To do this, we try to develop a snake game, which is the classic snake game on mobile phones.
The snake game has been broken down into several parts to be done across 2 lessons. For this lesson, we'll be touching on:
- creating the snake
- getting the snake to move
- getting the snake to change direction

The tasks today are separated into 2, the snake game itself as well as the snake class.
