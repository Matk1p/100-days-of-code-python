Today, went more in depth on classes and OOP. Learnt how to:
- create classes on our own with the python conventions
- how to use constructors
- how to call methods
- how to initialise an instance of an object 

With this, the coding project for the day is to implement a simple True, False Quiz

- quiz-game-start acts as the manager, or the main in this case
- question_model acts to turn the questions taken from the question bank into question objects
- quiz brain has the methods needed to run the quiz
