# Day 13

Today the lesson is centred around debugging. Debugging is the process of finding what is causing the code to break / not run properly.
Names after an incident where a programmer found an actual moth that caused her program to not run properly.
Debugging can be broken down into several steps:
1. Describe and break the problem down into smaller pieces
2. Try to reproduce the bug
3. Imagine you're the computer
4. Fix the errors
5. Print is your best friend
6. Use a debugger
7. Take a break
8. Ask a friend
9. Run your code often, don't wait until you have a lot of codes and ending up with a pile of bug
10. Stackoverflow

These tips are then used in the exercises to put them into use.
