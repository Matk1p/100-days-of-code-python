# Day 30

Learning about Errors, exceptions and how to handle them. Mainly by learning the use of try and except blocks, similar to the 
try catch block learnt in java previously. Most of the contents are found in:
- [Errors&Exceptions.py](https://github.com/Matk1p/100-days-of-code-python/blob/b61642fd1d8a355a72d8dc4d702ef6bae112d7da/D30/Errors&Exceptions.py) where we look at the different types of Errors and which scenarios could trigger which exception
- [ExceptionHandling.py](https://github.com/Matk1p/100-days-of-code-python/blob/b61642fd1d8a355a72d8dc4d702ef6bae112d7da/D30/ExceptionHandling.py) where we learn how to "catch" these errors

The lesson includes coding room activities
- [FruitPie.py](D30/FruitPie.py) where we take a look at IndexError
- [total_likes.py](D30/total_likes.py) where we take a look at KeyErrors

Next, we improved our previous projects, namely the [NATO alphabet project](https://github.com/Matk1p/100-days-of-code-python/blob/b61642fd1d8a355a72d8dc4d702ef6bae112d7da/D30/NATO-alphabet-start) & the [password manager](https://github.com/Matk1p/100-days-of-code-python/blob/b61642fd1d8a355a72d8dc4d702ef6bae112d7da/D30/password-manager-2.0) to incorporate exception handling
and even implemnted a search feature, where a user could search his credentials through a json file, to improve UX
