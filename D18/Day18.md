# Day 18

Today, we go in deeper with the turtle moduel package from python and how to import modules that need to be installed before it is able to be used.
Some of the elements learnt today are:
- Exploring and understanding a library documentation
- Installing pyhton modules
- Getting a colour palette from an image from the colorgram library

Some of these lessones are put into action in the following programs:
- DrawSquare to get us started with turtle libary
- DrawDashedLines to practice documentation reading and googling to help get what we need
- RandomWalk
- Spirograph
- Hirst Project as a final project for the day to apply everything taught today
