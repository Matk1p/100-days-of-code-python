# Day 5

Today I've learnt more on loops, particularly the for loops in python.
The most useful is the different ways to have a for loop and understand when to use which. 
This is also supplemented with:
- For loops in Lists
- For loops in range() function

The lessons are implemented in:
- Determining the average height from a list of heights
- Using loops to extract the highest scores from a range of scores
- Add even numbers in the range os 1 - 100 (inclusive)
- "FizzBuzz" challenge with numbers from 1 to 100
