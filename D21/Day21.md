# Day 21

The continuation of the [snake game project](https://github.com/Matk1p/100-days-of-code-python/blob/339929c7c4d7695f33a9cc3df8ff531cdcfdd7be/D20/SnakeGame). Today we continued on:
- implementing the food class so that the snake has food to consume
- implementing the scoreboard class to keep track of the score
- working around wall collisions
- working on collisions with snake body

New concepts learnt today:
- inheritance in classes
- slicing in python
