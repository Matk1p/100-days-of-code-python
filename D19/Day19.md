# Day 19

Today, we've expanded on the turtle graphics module. This time, the focus was more on creating multiple instances from the same class. 
Reinforcing the idea as to how classes can be though of a blueprints, and we can set the individual attributes
in each instance to be different.

Also, learn how to make a program that listens to events. To me, this can be likened to taking inputs from the user in a program.

The concepts we learn today:
- expanding on documentation reading
- setting event listeners to trigger certain events
- creating multiple instances from the same class

The concepts are then put into good use in:
- EventListener to be more familiar with the concept of taking user input on the fly
- DrawingTurtlePath where we add on to the variety of events
- TurtleRace where we create multiple instances of turtles and pit them against each other
