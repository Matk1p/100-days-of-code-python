# Day 11

Today, I attempted the first capstone project. To build a simple black jack program.
This makes use of the things I've learnt, including the data types, random library, using the various
versions of functions. 

The challenge is tackling the different possibilities and/or outcomes, and in a deck of cards, 
different possibilities are very high.

Some assumptions to take note. 
-   This game does not behave as a typical deck, in which the cards ar finite. This takes in
    any values from the list of card values, no matter the cards already taken.
-   This game does not include placing of bets
-   Does not include Jokers (only includes Jacks, Kings, Queens & Aces)
-   Aces can take the value of 11
-   Only a 2 player game
