# Day 25

For today, we took the learning from the files lessons on day 24 and use different libraries to help us go through the
files for data. First, we just extracted data from what was taught, which proved to be slightly long-winded. We used the 
CSV library next, which was still long-winded. Then we were introduced to pandas library which was the game changing 
library.

This lesson mainly focused on what and how to use the pandas library. Things we learn:
- how to read files using pandas
- how to extract certain data
- how to get data via columns
- how to import the data and export them into another CSV file

Some activities done today:
1. Weather - basic introduction to pandas csv reading functions
2. Squirrels - dealing with larger data sets and how to make sense of the data, only extracting what was needed
3. US-states-game - made a game that requires users to guess the state. Answers were located in a different file.
