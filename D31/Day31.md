# Day 31

Finally, restarted my journey after taking a break to prioritise studying for finals.
Managed to pick up where I've left off in completing the capstone challenge in the flashcard app.

**Objective**

To make an app that will help will memory. 

The app will flash a word in the French language for 3 seconds and if the user remembers the english translation, they can choose the
tick option so that the user will not see the already learnt word anymore. 

After 3 seconds, the answer (the english translation) will be shown. 

Else, they can choose the cross option so that the word will keep re-appearing until it could be committed to memory.

Challenges in this capstone project:
- Mostly, even in the recent projects, I'm still not quite solid in using the pandas library as multiple references have to be made
- The logic from problems 1-3 were relatively doable, although broken down into several sessions across some days
