### Day 15

Today is essentially, a lesson on working / coding in the local envinrontment.
Had the opportunity to refresh what was taught when I first started using an IDE

The development environment of choice is pyCharm, specialised for Python
Some key features why pyCharm is chosen:
- English spell check checker
- Easy toggling between 2 different files
- Built-in linter (smth that picks out style-guide inconsistencies)
- Ability to view local history
- Ability to view structure of code
- Refactoring capabilities


#### Side note
PyCharm kept crashing, so instead I wrote the program on VSC. So technically, the lesson to teach pycharm tips & tricks ccanot really be  applied


However, for today, the project is to make a coffee machine that can achieve the following goals
1. Print a report on the ingredients made for coffee + money made from the coffee sold
2. Check if what the user is requesting can be made with the ingredients left in the coffee machine
3. Process the coins that the user puts into the machine for payment    
    - making sure it is enough to pay the cost of the drink
    - giving back the user the proper change
4. If the transaction is successful, make the coffee
