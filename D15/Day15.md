# Day 15

Today is essentially, a lesson on working / coding in the local envinrontment.
Had the opportunity to refresh what was taught when I first started using an IDE

The development environment of choice is pyCharm, specialised for Python
Some key features why pyCharm is chosen:
    - English spell check checker
    - Easy toggling between 2 different files
    - Built-in linter (smth that picks out style-guide inconsistencies)
    - Ability to view local history
    - Ability to view structure of code
    - Refactoring capabilities
