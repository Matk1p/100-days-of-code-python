# Day 14

Today, the exercise is more focused on revision. In which I had to use what was taught previously to try and make the Higher or Lower game. This game takes in the values of instagram followers and has been gaciously provided in the GameData File.

More on this game:
- This game takes 2 contenders, both with smth in common to compare. In this case would be instagram followers
- Contenders can br from the likes of celebrities, athletes, and even companies
- Player will have to guess which option, A or B, has the higher follower count
- If the player is successful in his choice, the option B from the current round will be the next round's option A
