# Day 6

Today, I've learnt
- define my own functions
- while loops 
- stopping conditions for said while loops

Today is different, because instead of exercises to solve code, the exercise was hosted on [Reeborg's world](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json)
where we solve the maze puzzles using what has been taught in the lessons
