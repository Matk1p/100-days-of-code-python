# Day 24

Today, we learn about files, and how to manipulate them. These are the concepts of files that we touched on today:
- opening a file
- closing a file
- the python convention of opening a file
- using files to keep track of past data
- directories and how to get them

From these concepts, we use it to improve our snake game and save the "high score" so that we can keep track of our past high score

Other than the game improvement, most of the concepts are used in the Mail Merge Project
1. Has a list of guests to be invited
2. Has a letter to be sent out to guests
3. Task - change the "[name]" placeholder with each of the individual guest name
4. Save the modified letters into the Output folder
