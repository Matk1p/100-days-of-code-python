# Day 16

Diving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Developed to help maintain the relationships in code as our code becomes more & more complex. Can split the program into modules, 
allowing us to better split the work. Additionally, the modules could be used for future projects.
Model the program as separate objects. Each object is responsible for certain things.
- attributes -> things that the object has (variable)
- methods -> what the objects can do (functions)
- Class -> the blueprint for an object, can create instances of the object
- Using python packages

Packages -> can use PyPi to look at the python packages developed by other python developers to use their code. There are also 
documentation on how to use the code so that we can apply it into our project
+ PyCharm -> preferences -> Python interpreter -> add packages   

So the exercise for the day is to actually put the coffee machine program that has been written on day 15 into a more modular version with
classes and objects
