# Day 12

Learning on the concept of scope. Need to determing the nature of the variable, whether it is a global or local variable
which means, need to determine where the variable is going to be. Local variables exist only in functions while global variables can 
be accessed from any scope.

This is taught with:
    - Scope
    - Global & local variable
    - How to call and modify global variables
    - bad coding practices with global variables
    - how global variables can be substituted with constant final variables instead 
    - return the variable instead to "modify" it instead

All the concepts are exercised in the following:
    - GlobalConstan varibale: to highlight the different use cases of the different variable types
    - Modifying global variables: how to modify and the best coding practices surrounding it
    - scopingEnemies: brief introduction as to what quantifies as a global and local variable, and the introduction of the scope concept
    - GuessTheNumber: amalgamation of the previously taught concepts where user tries to guess the number chosen by the program
