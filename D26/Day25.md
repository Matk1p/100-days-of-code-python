# Day 26

Today, learnt about list comprehensions, how to use them in the different situations for different data types such as:
- lists
- dictionaries
- dataframes

For the exercises, there were plenty, we have with different variety, they are:
1. Coding Room exercises
2. Revisiting past code to apply the newly found knowledge of list comprehension
3. Building a new project

Coding Room projects that require application of list comprehension alone are:
- EvenNumbersOnly
- squaringNumbers
- MatchingNumbersIn2Lists

Coding Room projects that require application of list comprehension in dictionaries are:
- ConvertDegree (where we convert degree in Celcius to Farenheit from a dictionary)
- ConvertToDict

Made changes to D25th US game main.py to include list comprehension as an improvement to the code

Built a program that transforms the given input into its phonetic nato equivalent while using the techniques to read files 
using pandas library
