# Day 7

Today, I used the different things taught from previous days to make a simple hangman application game.
Some elements that I've used are:
- functions
- random
- lists
- loops
- modules

Some elements that I plan to revist to improve the game are:
- allow player to guess words from the get go
- some clue function when their lives are reaching the end
