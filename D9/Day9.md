# Day 9

Today, I learn about the python dictionaries. From this lesson, I can draw some similarities between dictionaries and the Hashmaps, learnt in Java. Both the data structures operates with a key value pair. 

Other than the initial similarities, here's what I learnt today:
- Dictionaries and how to manipulate them
- Iterating through Dictionaries
- Nested Dictionaries
- Nested Lists in Dictionaries
- Nested Dictionaries in Lists

This is applied to these exercises:
- Student Grades, changing the values in a dictionary
- Travel Log, to append new dictionaries in lists
- Implemented the Highest Bidder program as a final exercise that consists of the lessons taught throughout the session
