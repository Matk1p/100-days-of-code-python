# Day 4

On this day, I learn:
- python libraries and how to use them with import
- making our own files to break the project down, making them more modular
- random library in python
- Python Lists
- List manipulation
- finally, applied everything learnt today with the final Rock Paper Scissors Project

The things I've learnt are implemented by:
- implementing random and my own python libraries in Random.py file
- random number generators to make the Coin Toss game
- Selecting a random object from a list of objects in BankerRoulette
- Manipulating lists by choosing a spot to change the object to an "X"
- implemented a rock paper scissors game played between a user and the computer
