# Day 28

Going in a little further with the GUI application learning. Today, we practised the things taught on day 27, and added a few more concepts namely:
- canvas, built into the tkinter library
- how python is a strongly & dynamically typed language

Adding on to the 2nd point, python knows what data types are needed for methods/functions being called which makes it
strong typed. However, there is no need for a variable to have its data type declared when initialising them, at the same time, 
the same variable can be changed to take in different data types from when it was initialised.

In order to further delve into the tkinter and GUI projects, we made a pomodoro application. Some of its features are:
1. keep track of the 25 mins work, 5 mins rest cycles
2. keep track of the number of cycles the user have gone through
3. making use of images in tkinter 
4. making use of canvas
