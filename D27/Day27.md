# Day 27

Learning tkinter and the concept of easing the user's experience in using the program.
To understand that, need to understand how the user can pass us the input (argument). This leads to
the idea of unlimited number of arguments, and how to pass them to the program. As a gist, today, we learn:
- GUI concept
- unlimited arguments (*args)
- key word arguments (**kwarg)

From the lessons learnt, practiced in these files
- python_arguments - to understand the concept of unlimited arguments and key word arguments
- learningTkinter - understanding how a GUI works and how it helps the user use the program
- MileToKem - inculcate the concepts learnt to make a GUI program that converts miles to km
