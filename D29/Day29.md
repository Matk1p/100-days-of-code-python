# Day 29

Basis of the lesson focuses around building a password manager application. This application allows the user to generate a secure password
and save them, along with the website name and username/email used into a text file, stored locally in the user's computer.
The password will be randomly generated using a series of letters, numbers and symbols.

The program uses functionalities from previous days which include:
- setting up UI with tkinter canvas
- setting up button and label functionalities with tkinter
- using list comprehensions to improve code from previously built applications for password generator function
- writing into files
